üìò Database Concepts, SQL, and Pandas for Data Science & Analyst Interviews
üåü Introduction
In top tech interviews, your ability to query data, manipulate tables, and extract insights is as important as your ability to build machine learning models.

This document is a complete preparation guide covering:

Core database concepts.

Advanced SQL querying.

Practical Pandas usage.

How SQL and Pandas complement each other.

üõ†Ô∏è 1. Core Database Concepts (with Examples)
üìç 1.1 Relational Databases (RDBMS)
Definition:
A database where data is stored in tables. Tables can relate to each other through keys.

Key Elements:

Table: Collection of rows (records) and columns (fields).

Row: A single record.

Column: An attribute or feature.

Primary Key: Uniquely identifies each row (e.g., user_id).

Foreign Key: Refers to a primary key in another table (e.g., order.user_id ‚Üí user.id).

‚úÖ Practice Task:
Explain the relationship between a users table and an orders table in 2 sentences.

üìç 1.2 Normalization and Denormalization
Normalization:

Organize data to reduce redundancy.

Achieve 1NF, 2NF, 3NF (normal forms).

Example: Splitting address fields into a separate table.

Denormalization:

Merging tables to speed up read performance.

Used in analytics or reporting systems.

‚úÖ Practice Task:
Sketch a database design for a movie review site (users, movies, reviews). Normalize it.

üìç 1.3 Joins
Types of Joins:

Join Type	Description
INNER JOIN	Return rows with matching values.
LEFT JOIN	Return all rows from the left table + matching ones from the right.
RIGHT JOIN	Return all rows from the right table.
FULL OUTER JOIN	Return rows when there is a match in either table.
Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT users.name, orders.amount
FROM users
LEFT JOIN orders
ON users.id = orders.user_id;
‚úÖ Practice Task:
Write SQL to get all users and their total order amount (even if they made no orders).

üìç 1.4 Indexes
Indexes = Data structures that make searching faster.

Without indexes, SQL does full table scans ‚Üí Slow for large datasets.

Indexes are built on columns that are frequently searched or joined.

‚úÖ Practice Task:
Why is it bad to index every column? (Hint: trade-off between read and write speeds.)

üìç 1.5 Transactions and ACID
Transactions:

A unit of work executed completely or not at all.

ACID Properties:

Property	Meaning
Atomicity	All parts of a transaction succeed or none do.
Consistency	Database remains in valid state.
Isolation	Concurrent transactions don't interfere.
Durability	Once committed, changes are permanent.
‚úÖ Practice Task:
Give an example where transactions are needed in a payment system.

üìç 1.6 Views and CTEs
View: A virtual table based on a SQL query.

CTE: Temporary result set you can reference inside a query using WITH.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
WITH recent_orders AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM orders
  WHERE created_at >= '2024-01-01'
)
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*)
FROM recent_orders
GROUP BY user_id;
‚úÖ Practice Task:
When would you prefer a CTE over a subquery?

üìç 1.7 Window Functions
Functions that operate across a set of rows relative to the current row.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT user_id, order_id, 
       RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at DESC) as order_rank
FROM orders;
PARTITION BY = restart the window per user.

ORDER BY = sort within each partition.

‚úÖ Practice Task:
Write a query to find each user's second most expensive order.

üìç 1.8 Aggregations
GROUP BY groups data.

HAVING filters groups after aggregation.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
‚úÖ Practice Task:
Find customers who ordered more than 3 different products.

üõ†Ô∏è 2. SQL Skills (Deep Dive)
Must-Master SQL Topics:
SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY

DISTINCT, LIMIT

CASE WHEN THEN ELSE

Nested Subqueries (in SELECT, FROM, WHERE)

Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full)

CTEs and Views

Window Functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), SUM() OVER()

Aggregates: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()

NULL handling: IS NULL, COALESCE(), CASE

Type casting: CAST(amount AS FLOAT)

‚úÖ SQL Mini Challenge:
Write a query that shows, for each product category, the top 3 products by sales revenue.

üõ†Ô∏è 3. Pandas Skills (for Data Analysis)
Pandas is Python‚Äôs answer to SQL.

Key Pandas Functions
Concept	SQL	Pandas
Select Columns	SELECT col1, col2 FROM table	df[['col1', 'col2']]
Filter Rows	WHERE condition	df[df['col'] > 5]
Sort Rows	ORDER BY col	df.sort_values('col')
Group and Aggregate	GROUP BY col	df.groupby('col').agg()
Join Tables	JOIN	pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key')
Create new Columns	SELECT CASE...	df['new_col'] = np.where(...)
Window Functions	OVER(PARTITION BY...)	df.groupby('col').rank()
Pivot Data	PIVOT	df.pivot_table()
Essential Pandas Patterns
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

# Load
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Filter
df[df['revenue'] > 1000]

# Group
df.groupby('category')['revenue'].sum()

# Merge
pd.merge(orders, users, on='user_id', how='left')

# Window
df['running_total'] = df['sales'].cumsum()

# Handle NULLs
df['discount'].fillna(0, inplace=True)
‚úÖ Practice Task:
Download any sample dataset (like Kaggle's "Sales Data") and:

Filter top products

Find category-wise revenue

Fill missing prices

Rank products within each category

üõ†Ô∏è 4. SQL + Pandas Workflow
Step	SQL	Pandas
1. Pull raw data from database	Use SELECT * FROM table	pd.read_sql(query, connection)
2. Preprocess basic filters and joins	Joins, Where, Subqueries	merge(), filtering
3. Feature engineering	CASE WHEN THEN	Create new columns
4. Aggregate & summarize	GROUP BY	groupby()
5. Model building or insights	No SQL	Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
